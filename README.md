Documentation 📖
The State Machine is designed to be simple yet flexible. Here's how you can get started:

Initializing a State Machine

local myStateMachine = stateMachine.init()
Creating a State

```lua
myStateMachine:create_state("StateName", function() 
    -- State logic here
end, {condition1 = true, condition2 = false})
Shifting States

myStateMachine:shift_state("StateName")
```
For more detailed information, refer to the code comments in statemachine.lua.
Examples 🌈
Here's a simple example of using the State Machine:

```lua

-- Initialize the state machine
local myStateMachine = stateMachine.init()

-- Create states
myStateMachine:create_state("Idle", function()
    print("Currently in Idle state")
end)

myStateMachine:create_state("Running", function()
    print("Currently Running")
end)

-- Shift to a state
myStateMachine:shift_state("Idle")
```
